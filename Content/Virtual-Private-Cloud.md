# Virtual Private Cloud(VPC)

- VPC is your own private network in aws.
- In AWS, you get a VPC by default.
- It allows you to define private IP range for your AWS resources.
- You often place these VPCâ€™s in different subnets.
- Subnets are chunks of IP addresses in your VPC that allows you to group resources together.
- To allow inward/outward traffic to enter  VPC, you must attach an Internet Gateway(IGW) to it.
- To allow traffic from specific networks only, you must install a virtual private gateway.
- Virtual private Gateway allows us to create a VPN connection from your private network and VPC.
- However as the VPC is open to internet, the public traffic can cause traffic congestion and result in latency.The solution to this is AWS DirectConnect
- AWS Direct Connect allows you to establish a direct fiber connection between your data center and VPC.
- There are no additional charges for creating and using VPC aside for Data Transfer charges of service.
