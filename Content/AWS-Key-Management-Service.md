# AWS AWS Key Management System(KMS)

- AWS KMS enables you to perform encryption operations through the use ofÂ cryptographic keys. 
- A cryptographic key is a random string of digits used for locking (encrypting) and unlocking (decrypting) data. 
- You can use AWS KMS to create, manage, and use cryptographic keys.
- You can also control the use of keys across a wide range of services and in your applications.
- You can choose the specific levels of access control that you need for your keys. For example, you can specify which IAM users and roles are able to manage keys.
