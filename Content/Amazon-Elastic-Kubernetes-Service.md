# Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service

- Amazon EKS is a fully managed service that allows you to run Kubernetes on AWS.
- Kubernetes is an open source container orchestration framework.
- Among the primary features of Kubernetes are service discovery and load balancing, orchestrating storage, including persistent storage, automated rollbacks for containerized applications, self-healing for Kubernetes clusters, secrets, and configuration management.
- With the unmanaged Kubernetes installation, users need to update control plane components and the nodes. With the managed EKS service, the control plane will be the responsibility of AWS, while there are different approaches for the data plane.
- A large community of volunteers maintains Kubernetes, and AWS actively works together with the Kubernetes community so new updates are easily applied to applications managed by Amazon EKS.
