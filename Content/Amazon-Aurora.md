# Amazon Aurora

- Amazon Aurora is a relational database management system (RDBMS) built for the cloud with full MySQL and PostgreSQL compatibility
- Aurora gives you the performance and availability of commercial-grade databases at one-tenth the cost.
- Aurora offers higher availability and better durability than RDS, due to its unique storage model, and ability to perform continuous backups and restore with a very low RPO.
- Every Aurora cluster has six storage nodes, spread across three AZs, even if you have just one compute node and continuously backs up you-r data to Amazon S3.
- Amazon Aurora helps to reduce your database costs by reducing unnecessary I/O operations.
