# Organisational Unit

- In AWS Organizations, you can group accounts into organizational units (OUs) to make it easier to manage accounts with similar business or security requirements.
- When you apply a policy to an OU, all the accounts in the OU automatically inherit the permissions specified in the policy.Â -
