# Amazon Simple Storage Service

- Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is a service that provides object-level storage. 
- Amazon S3 stores data as objects in buckets.
- In object storage, each object consists of data, metadata, and a key.
- The data might be an image, video, text document, or any other type of file.
- Metadata contains information about what the data is, how it is used, the object size, and so on. 
- An object’s key is its unique identifier.
- When you modify a file in block storage, only the pieces that are changed are updated but  when a file in object storage is modified, the entire object is updated.
- You can also version objects to prevent accidental deletion of object.
- The maximum object size that you can upload is 5TB.
- You can add permissions to who can see or access buckets.
- You can also host static website on S3.
