# Amazon Database Migration Service

- Helps  you to migrate relational databases, nonrelational databases, and other types of data stores  between a source database and a target databases of same or different types.
- During the migration, your source database remains operational, reducing downtime for any applications that rely on the database.
- It allows Continuous Replication which means sending ongoing copies of your data to other target sources instead of doing a one-time migration.
- It also allows Database Consolidation .
