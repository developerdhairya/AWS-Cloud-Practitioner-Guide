- It works with both Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS.
- When using AWS Fargate, you do not need to provision or manage servers. AWS Fargate manages your server infrastructure for you.
- Fargate prices are per second with no upfront charge.
- AWS Fargate will bill you based on the amount of vCPU, RAM, OS, CPU architecture, and storage that your containerized apps consume while running on EKS or ECS.
