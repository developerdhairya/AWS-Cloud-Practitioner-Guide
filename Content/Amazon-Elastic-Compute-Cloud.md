# Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud

- Amazon EC2 provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud as Amazon EC2 instances.
- It runs on top of big physical host machine AWS machines using virtualization technologyThis phenomenan is called multitenancy and hypervysor is responsible for coordinating multitenancy.
- EC2 instances are highly scalableand we can also scale it horizontally using Amazon EC2 autoscaling groups.
-  You donâ€™t pay for stopped or terminated instances because there is no computation power used by them but EBS volumes attached to instances continue to retain information and accrue charges.
