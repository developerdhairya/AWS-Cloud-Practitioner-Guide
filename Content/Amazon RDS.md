- Amazon RDS is a service that enables you to run relational databases in the AWS Cloud.
- It automates tasks such as hardware provisioning, database setup, patching, and backups
- Many Amazon RDS database engines offer encryption at rest (protecting data while it is stored) and encryption in transit (protecting data while it is being sent and received)
