# AWS Web Application Firewall

- AWS WAF is a web application firewall that lets you monitor network requests that come into your web applications.
- It works together with Amazon CloudFront and an Application Load Balancer
- It works in a similar way  like NACL to block or allow traffic. However, it does this by using a Web Access Control List to protect your AWS resources.
- It can filter traffic on conditions like IP addresses, HTTP headers, HTTP body, URI strings, SQL injection and cross-site scripting.
