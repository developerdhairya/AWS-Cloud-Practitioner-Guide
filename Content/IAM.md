## IAM User

- IAM User is identity that you can crete in AWS which has name and credentials.
- It represents either the person or application that interacting AWS services.
- You should create individual IAM users for each person who needs to access AWS even if you have multiple employees who require the same level of acces.
- Tags are used to facilitate attribute-based access control for IAM users. It allows access to resources to be granted based on an attribute with an entity. This feature is useful where the access required is temporary or project-based.
